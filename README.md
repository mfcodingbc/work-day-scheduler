**Module 5: Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler**

This week's challenge was to create a Work Day Scheduler using JQuery and Moment.js. Also, inputs made by a user is stored in localStorage and recalled when the user returns to the page through JSON stringify and parse. The user provided code for the CSS and some code for the HTML, though all JavaScript coding was written by myself.

**User Story:**

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

**Acceptance Criteria**

*It is done*:
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
